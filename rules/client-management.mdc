# Client Management

When working with clients (called "businesses" in the API) through the Invoice My Clients MCP server, follow these conventions:

## Creating Clients

- Use `create_business` to create a new client record.
- At minimum, provide `businessName`. All other fields are optional but recommended.
- Check for existing clients before creating duplicates. Use `search_businesses` or `get_businesses` to search first.
- When the user provides a full address, map it to the individual fields: `businessStreetAddress1`, `businessStreetAddress2`, `businessCity`, `businessState`, `businessPostCode`.
- Default `preferredLanguage` to `en-US` unless the user specifies otherwise. `es-Mx` is also supported.

## Updating Clients

- Use `update_business` with only the fields that need changing.
- Always retrieve the client first with `get_business` to confirm the correct record before updating.

## Client Lookup

- Use `search_businesses` for fuzzy free-text search across name, email, and city.
- Use `get_businesses` with pagination for listing all clients.
- When a user refers to a client by name, search first and confirm the match before taking action.

## Client-Invoice Relationship

- Clients are linked to invoices through the invoice's client fields (e.g., `clientName`, `clientEmail`).
- When creating an invoice for a client, pass `businessName` or `businessEmail` to `create_invoice`. The system auto-populates the invoice's client fields from the matched business record.
- To see all invoices for a client, use `get_invoices` and filter by client name.

## Data Quality

- Encourage users to provide email addresses for clients to enable reliable matching.
- Phone numbers should include area codes.
- Client IDs are UUIDs; always retrieve them from the API, never fabricate them.
