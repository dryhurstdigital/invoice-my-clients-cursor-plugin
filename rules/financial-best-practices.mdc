# Financial Best Practices

When handling financial aspects of invoices through Invoice My Clients, follow these guidelines:

## Tax Handling

- Tax percentage is configured in user settings. Retrieve with `get_user_settings`.
- Individual line items can be marked as taxable or non-taxable via `invoiceItemTaxable`.
- Tax is calculated on the subtotal of taxable items only.
- Never assume a tax rate; always check user settings first.

## Payment Terms

- Payment terms come from user settings (e.g., Net 30).
- Due dates are calculated from the invoice date based on the configured payment terms.
- Do not override payment terms unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Rates

- Default hourly rate comes from user settings.
- When creating invoice items without specifying a rate, the system defaults to the user's hourly rate.
- Always confirm rates with the user when they differ significantly from the default.

## Discounts

- Discounts can be percentage-based or monetary amounts.
- Apply discounts at the invoice level, not the item level.
- Clearly show the discount amount and the resulting total.

## Interest

- Interest on overdue payments is configured in user settings.
- Interest can be calculated monthly or weekly.
- Always inform the user about interest implications when working with overdue invoices.

## Multi-Step Financial Operations

- When performing bulk operations (e.g., creating multiple invoices), always:
  1. Retrieve user settings once at the start.
  2. Confirm the operation plan with the user.
  3. Execute operations sequentially, reporting progress.
  4. Provide a final summary of all operations.

## Early Payment Discounts

- Configurable at global, client, and invoice levels.
- When creating invoices, check if the client has specific early payment discount settings.
- Mention early payment discounts when relevant.
