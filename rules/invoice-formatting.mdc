# Invoice Formatting

When presenting invoice data to the user, follow these formatting conventions:

## Currency

- Format monetary values with two decimal places and appropriate currency symbols (e.g., `$1,250.00`).
- When calculating totals, multiply quantity by rate for each line item.
- Show subtotal, tax (if applicable), and total separately.
- If a discount is present, show it as a separate line.

## Dates

- Present dates in a human-readable format (e.g., "February 17, 2026").
- For due dates, also mention how many days from now (e.g., "Due: March 19, 2026 (30 days)").

## Invoice Status

- Use clear labels for statuses:
  - `DRAFT` - "Draft" (not yet sent)
  - `SENT` - "Sent" (awaiting payment)
  - `VOIDED` - "Voided" (cancelled)
  - `CANCELLED_REBILLED` - "Cancelled & Rebilled"
  - `DELETED` - "Deleted"
- For payment statuses:
  - `PAID` - "Paid"
  - `PARTIALLY_PAID` - "Partially Paid"
  - `UNPAID` - "Unpaid"
  - `PROCESSING` - "Processing"

## Summaries

- When listing multiple invoices, present them in a table format:
  | Invoice # | Client | Status | Total | Date |
- Sort by date (newest first) unless the user requests otherwise.
- Include pagination info if there are more results (e.g., "Showing 10 of 45 invoices").

## Line Items

- Present line items in a clear table:
  | Description | Qty | Rate | Amount |
- Show the calculated amount (qty × rate) for each line.
- Include a total row at the bottom.

## Confirmations

- After creating or updating an invoice, confirm the action with a summary.
- Include the invoice number, client name, and key details in the confirmation.
- Provide a link to view the invoice in the app when possible.
